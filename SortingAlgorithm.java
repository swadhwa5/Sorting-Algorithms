/**
 * The essence of a sorting algorithm.
 <p>
   Note that in order to sort, some random type T would not be good enough.
   Things to be sorted need an *order*, and we need a way to compare things,
   not just for equality (there's an equals() method on all objects) but
   for less-than and greater-than as well.
 </p>
 <p>
   This is why we need a *bounded* type parameter: Not just *any* T will do,
   only those that are at least of type Comparable. That, in turn, ensures
   that we have a method compareTo() that we can use to establish order. See
   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html for
   more.
 </p>
